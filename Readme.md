<h2>How to play?</h2>
All the previous things are very nice and cool, but... How can I play it? It is a conversational game so, where isthe map? which  actions I have to type? Which...? Don't get nervous,
in the following sections it is going to be explained all your doubs about how to play</p>

<h3>Introduction & Purpose</h3>
Zork, he is the heroe of this advenure, has been captured and jailed by orcs. What orcs don't know is that Zork has allwed them to capture him and be jailed in the cave of NighDead,
a dragon. Zork did it because it was the easiest way to go inside the cave. Now, your duty as Zork assistant is to guide him till dragon's cave to kill NighDead. One the dragon is killed
you have to search for an scape.</p>
<p>You shuld be adviced that Zork <b>loves killing orcs</b> so, if there's any orc in the room Zork won't do anything till he orc is dead. But you need to be fast, orcs aren't statues
and if they see or smell Zork they will kill him.</p>
<p>During your wondering you can find some objects with locks. yes LOCKS! To open them you don't need to search a key, you just need to solve the question each item has.
the answer can be from a year to a name.  part from run you will have to think.</p>
<p>To conclude, you ypu have to guide Zork, kill NightDead and scape alive.</p>

<h3>Problems deected</h3>
<p>A bug has been detected while testing the game. For some reason, after playing and giving some orders o Zork, Zork doesn't understand the orders, but after a few orders
more Zork starts to undersand orders again. I'm trying to find in which part of the loop is the problem.</p>
<p>Sorry!</p>
